Start working on a quest using the MCP startQuest tool.

If the user didn't provide a quest ID, first list their pending quests using the listQuests tool, then ask which quest they want to start.

Call the startQuest MCP tool with the quest ID and confirm that the quest has been started with the timestamp.
