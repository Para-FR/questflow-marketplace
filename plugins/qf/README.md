## Configuration

### Switching Between Environments

To switch between local and production, run `/qf:setup` again and choose a different environment. Or manually edit `.mcp.json`:

**Local Development:**
```json
"QUESTFLOW_API_URL": "http://localhost:3014"
```

**Production:**
```json
"QUESTFLOW_API_URL": "https://quest.cc-france.org"
```

### Troubleshooting

**Error: QUESTFLOW_API_KEY is required**
- Run `/qf:setup` to configure your API key
- Or generate a new key manually at your environment's /settings page

**Error: 401 Unauthorized**
- Your API key may be revoked or invalid
- Run `/qf:setup` to reconfigure with a new key

**Server not responding**
- **Local**: Ensure QuestFlow dev server is running on port 3014 (`bun run dev`)
- **Production**: Check your internet connection
- Verify `QUESTFLOW_API_URL` in `.mcp.json` matches your environment

**Bun not found**
- Run `/qf:setup` which will install Bun automatically
- Or install manually: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

## Development

Test the MCP server directly:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/qf
bun run dev
```
